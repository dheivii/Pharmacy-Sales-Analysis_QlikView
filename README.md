# Pharmacy-Sales-Analysis_QlikView
I developed three interactive dashboards in QlikView to analyze Seradic-P sales, including overall performance (May–Sep 2023), state &amp; headquarter sales overview, and Delhi region sales. Using two datasets, I performed data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization to generate actionable sales insights.
