# Pharmacy-Sales-Analysis_QlikView
I developed three interactive dashboards in QlikView to analyze Seradic-P sales, including overall performance (May–Sep 2023), state &amp; headquarter sales overview, and Delhi region sales. Using two datasets, I performed data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization to generate actionable sales insights.
# Seradic-P & Delhi Sales Analysis – Internship Project

## Project Overview

This project was developed during my internship, where I worked with two datasets: **Seradic-P sales data (May–Sep 2023)** and **Delhi region sales data**. The goal was to analyze sales performance across states, headquarters, and products to identify trends, growth opportunities, and weak areas.

The process included:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Python**
* Data visualization and dashboard creation using **QlikView**
* Development of three interactive dashboards


## Datasets Used

1. **Seradic-P Sales Data (May–Sep 2023)**

   * State-wise and headquarter-wise sales
   * Net sales amount and quantity
   * Credit/returns data

2. **Delhi Region Sales Data**

   * Product-level sales information
   * Division-wise sales data
   * Monthly comparisons

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* **QlikView** – Dashboard Development & Visualization
